# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start the project run:

### `npm start`

This, runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will see an input, once you start typing it will fetch users from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` and filter them.

Once you get items loaded into the autocomplete you can:

- Cycle through them using up and down keys
- Hit enter on a selected item. That will close the autocomplete and set the search to its value.
- Hit escape to lose focus on the input and another escape to close autocomplete and reset its search.
- Click on an item to close autocomplete and set search to its value.
